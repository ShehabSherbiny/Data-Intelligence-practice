    "## Introduction\n",
    "Throughout human history, vast amounts of data have been collected and stored. It is not until recently, however, that the immense value that can be generated from the data has been recognised. Thus, buzzwords like big data, AI, and data analysis have appeared, and now makes up a billion dollar industry (Provost & Fawcett, 2013). This report will be in line with this trend, and aim at making some sense from a simple dataset, seemingly stemming from a sharing economy housing site, in line with AirBnb. Firstly, the framework will be outlined, with an introduction to the used libraries with regards to their capabilities and their application in the analysis. This will be followed by an initial description of the data at hand, including information such as the format and the contents of the dataset. Hereafter, some visualisations of parts of the data will be provided, primarily to portray the data, and thus provide an initial understanding of selected parts of the data. This aforementioned part will provide the insights required to enable some data cleaning, where unnecessary columns can be dropped, in order to simplify the dataset. Then, two hypotheses will be formulated and presented, which then will be analysed and eventually evaluated upon. Subsequently, a third hypothesis will be proposed, finally leading to a discussion of the findings. Conclusively, the insights provided by this report will be presented, showcasing the knowledge generated by analysis of the dataset."

    "### pandas\n",
    "Pandas is short for Python Data Analysis Library, and it is an effective and time efficient software library written for the Python programming language. It's primary purpose is data manipulation in order to make data cleaning and analysis relatively simple. Furthermore, pandas is often used in connection to analytical libraries such as scikit-learn and data visualisation tools such as matplotlib and seaborn (this report is no exception). Furthermore, pandas is one of the most popular tools in data wrangling, probably partly due to it being open source and free to use. One of the eye-catching features of pandas is its ability to take a CSV-file or SQL database and create dataframes - a Python object with rows and columns similar to a table in Microsoft Excel (McKinney, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib & Seaborn\n",
    "In order to perform visualisatons of the data, the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries will be made use of. The firstmentioned is a plotting library, which in particular has its capabilities in the Python programming language in its numerical mathematics extension known as Numpy (as will elaborated on below). In short, this enables the data to be plotted throught the use of general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits. The second visualisation library Seaborn is based on Matplotlib, as well enabling the making of statistical graphs (McKinney, 2017; Matplotlib, 2021). By utilising said libraries, it is possible to visualise the manipulated data, which will allow me to reach some meaning and implications of the data in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sklearn & Numpy\n",
    "With the purpose of performing calculations along with manipulating data Numpy will be utilised. That is due to the fact that Numpy supports complex arrays for which it offers comprehensive mathematical functions, which are helpful to handle these arrays. Hence, utilisation of Numpy is beneficial to this report in that it eases the processing of the dataset with regards to performing calculations on it (Numpy, 2021). In continuation hereof, the scikit-learn library is an effective and simple tool for predictive data analysis, and will thus be used to train and test a model. Additionally, scikit-learn is also compliant with Numpy, and thus along with its many capabilities in the fields of classification, regression, and clustering is a very potent tool (Scikit-learn, 2021; McKinney, 2017).

    "Given the data contains information such as \"host_id\", \"number_of_reviews\", \"last_review\", and \"reviews_per_month\", it is presumably gathered utilising an API, due to this data being unlikely to be found on the rental site.

While \"name\" and \"host_name\" miss only a few data entries, other columns like \"last_reivew\" and \"reviews_per_month\" miss more than 10.000 entries. Finally, it tells us that there are three data types in the dataset, namely integers, floats, and objects."

    "Below, part of the data has been visualised, portraying the count of the five entires of \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Queens\", \"Staten Island\", and \"Bronx\". The x-axis shows the neighbourhood group and the y-axis shows the count. This is done to show the distribution of the listings in terms of what neighbourhood group they belong to. While this is not done with a specific purpose other than getting acquinted with the dataset, it provides some value in understanding the dataset, portraying that the vast majority of the listings er located on Manhattan or in Brooklyn. The reason a countplot was used for this is that it can visualise the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable (Grant, 2019)."

The reason I chose to do this is that these columns contain data that seems irrelevant to the analysis I expect to perform. This information is regarding very specific topics, as e.g., \"id\" contains the unique id of the specific rental listing, and the \"host_name\" showing the name of the host seems irrelevant, and thus I will not be including that in any analysis. Finally, I chose to disregard the column \"neighbourhood\", due to the fact that this contains very specific information about a wide range of neighbourhoods, where \"neighbourhood_group\", containing information on the wider area the apartment/room is listed in, is relatively more applicable."

On the contrary, a model that predicts values completely disregarding any input featurs would score 0.0 in the r2. Thus, the r2-score is supposed to be as large as possible (Starmer, 2017).

    "## Discussion\n",
    "So, as apparant in the analysis, the initial hypotheses H1 and H2 were indeed supported by the findings. The average price did indeed differ significantly according to the neighbourhood group it is in and the type of room is for rent. This, however, does not come as a huge surprise, as it follows the presumptions regarding the logical phenomenon that the housing prices in general are higher in central New York like Manhattan and Brooklyn than in the more rural parts, such as Queens, Staten Island and Bronx. Furthermore, it is neither surprising that there is a connection between price and the type of room, as the data showed that the price for a whole apartment or home was significantly higher than the average price of a private room, which also was higher than that of a shared room. This analysis thus gives rise to investigating whether the connection is of the type causation, as opposed to correlation. While correlation simply shows that there is a connection between two or more factors, causation implies a relationship where a given factor is contingent on one (or more) factor(s) (Barocas, Hardt & Narayanan, n.d.). In other words, a change in the specific factor(s) would have a direct effect to the contingent factor. In this case, this would mean that the neighbourhood group and type of room directly has an effect on the price of the listing. However, this is not proven in this study, which merely proves there is atleast a correlation between the factors. Having said that, it is presumably a common phenomenon that the prices rise in correspondance to a more central location. Alike, the price presumably usually rises when you rent a whole home compared to renting a shared room (a private room being priced inbetween). This, however, is merely speculation, and thus gives rise to a further study of the nature of the relationship between price and location and type of room. \n",
    "\n",
    "H1 and H2 led to hypothesis H3, stating that a model could be trained to predict the prices of listings according to the neighbourhood groups, based on the observed data, through the use of linear regression. This, however, amounted in a model with an r2-score close to 0.0, meaning that the predictions of the model were merely slightly better than predicting without taking the observed data into consideration. This suggests that the contemporary model is not sufficient in predicting the prices according to the neighbourhood group based on the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the initial two hypotheses, once tested in the analysis, did prove to be in accordance with the actual data. On the contrary, H3 turned out to be invalid and should be rejected, on the grounds that the r2-score is not at a satisfactory level, in aiming to predict prices."

    "To conclude on this report, the analysis of this dataset made it apparent that there is a correlation between the price of a listing and the neighbourhood group it belongs to, and the type of room at hand. Meanwhile, however, it does not prove that the nature of the relationship is causation, although the relationship being of said type is very likely, as suggested in the discussion above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the linear regressional model suggested in the study did not predict prices according to neighbourhood group and type of room to a satisfactory level, with an r2-score being only merely over 0.0, which is the level at which the model would predict completely disregarding the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this report conclusively confirmed H1 and H2 by finding that there indeed is a connection between the price of a listing and the neighbourhood group and type of room, while not proving the relationship type of causation. In addition, H3 was not confirmed, as the findings of the linear regressional model were rejected, due to an unsatisfactory r2-score. "
